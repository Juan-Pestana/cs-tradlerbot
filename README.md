## AI-Driven Customer Support Chatbot for Tradler

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to serve as a customer support agent for the Tradler platform. The chatbot is built using modern technologies and tools to ensure an efficient and user-friendly experience for both users and managers. This is my first project deployed at work, and I aim to make it accessible for the team to understand its features, installation process, and usage.

## Features

### Chatbots for Different Roles

- **User Chatbot**: Designed for end-users, providing support based on a knowledge base specific to user needs.
- **Manager Chatbot**: Tailored for managers, accessing a separate knowledge base with manager-specific information.

### Knowledge Base

- The knowledge bases are stored in **Pinecone** as two distinct namespaces within an index.

### Session Management

- Conversations are saved in a **Turso database**, using **Drizzle ORM** for structured querying.

### Admin Page

- Allows filtering and searching through chatbot sessions.
- Enables customer support teams to analyze user issues and chatbot responses.
- Keeps the state of the filtering and session in the URL for easy sharing with the operations team.

### Real-Time Features

- **Vercelâ€™s AI SDK** is utilized for streaming responses and maintaining conversation states.

### Modular Architecture

- Built with **LangChain** to handle chatbot logic.
- Uses **ChatGPT** as the core LLM (Large Language Model).

### Framework and Deployment

- Developed using **Next.js** for a seamless web application framework.
- Hosted on **Vercel** for efficient deployment and scalability.
